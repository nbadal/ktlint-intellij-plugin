## [0.20.0] - 2023-12-26

### Changed

- Upgrade KtLint to 1.1.0
- Rework UI and UX
- Plugin can either be run in 'distract free' mode or 'manual' mode.
- In 'distract free' mode, ktlint format is run automatically after Intellij IDEA format, and on save. Violations which can be autocorrected are grouped into 1 single warning showing the number of violations that will be autocorrected. Each violation that can not be autocorrected is shown as error.
- In 'manual' mode, ktlint format is never run automatically. All violations found are shown as error.
- Suppress KtLint violations using `@Suppress` annotation instead of `// ktlint-disable`. This functionality is not yet entire stable. So please raise issues when the `@Suppress` annotation is not inserted properly.
- Error handling is improved.
- Support for IDEA version 233.*
